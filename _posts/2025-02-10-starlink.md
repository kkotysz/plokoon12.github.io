On **February 10th, 2025**, I had the thrilling opportunity to witness and photograph the **Starlink Group 11-10** launch from **Space Launch Complex 4E** at [Vandenberg Space Force Base](https://www.spacelaunchschedule.com/category/vandenberg-sfb/). This mission carried a **batch of 23 satellites** into **Low Earth Orbit**—another milestone in **SpaceX’s** ever-growing “mega-constellation,” which aims to provide global, space-based internet service.

### Mission Details

- **Mission**: Starlink Group 11-10  
- **Type**: Communications  
- **Orbit**: Low Earth Orbit  
- **Launch Cost**: $52,000,000  
- **Launch Time**: February 10, 2025, at 6:09 PM PST (February 11, 2025, at 3:09 AM CET)

From Goleta, located roughly 90 kilometers (60 miles) southeast of Vandenberg, the view was spectacular. In the first photo, you’ll notice the dramatic **fiery exhaust trail** cutting across the night sky. That small glowing point beneath the path of the rocket is Venus—providing a nice visual reference for just how bright this launch was.

### Location

Space Launch Complex 4E has witnessed **181** rockets lift off—every one of those an orbital launch attempt. Meanwhile, Vandenberg Space Force Base itself (established in 1941) has hosted **793** rocket launches. Originally built for military and missile testing, Vandenberg also supports **civil** and **commercial** space endeavors, including those by NASA and SpaceX. The base is operated by the United States Space Force’s **Space Launch Delta 30**, which manages the Western Range for space launches.

In the second image, you can see the **glowing rocket plume** and the **brightly lit nose cone** with more detail. The exhaust’s shape and texture reveal the incredible energy at work, propelling the satellite payloads into orbit.

### Watch a Launch Yourself

If you ever get a chance to be near Vandenberg or any other spaceport during a scheduled liftoff, be sure to check local viewing locations. There’s nothing quite like witnessing a rocket pierce the sky in real time.
