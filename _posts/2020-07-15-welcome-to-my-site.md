Hi!<br>
This is the start of my personal webpage. I will post here different content - news about astronomy, my work, `python` projects and many more (hopefully , we'll see... :wink:).

In this first post I'd like to write a little about [Jekyll][jekyll-home] project which I used to create this site. It is a very powerful tool for generation of blog-type static sites. It was written in [Ruby][ruby-home] programming language by Tom Preston-Werner, GitHub's co-founder. I strongly recommend to familiariaze yourself with `Jekyll`, especially if you want to launch your website using [GitHub Pages][gh-pages] - it integrates very well with `Jekyll`.

`Jekyll` offers a very large amount of themes to choose from and most of them are free and customizable (if acknowledgment is provided). The one that I am using is called [Minimal Mistakes][mmistakes]. Another advantage is that most of the website development is done in __markdown__. Knowledge of `Ruby` language and `html` may come in handy if you plan to go beyond what is offered by chosen theme. 

To get yourself started I can recommend this great [__tutorial__][jekyll-tut] made by Mike Dane from [Giraffe Academy][mike-dane].
