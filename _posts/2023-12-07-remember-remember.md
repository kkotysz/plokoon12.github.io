In recent months there has been an increased solar activity with quite a lot of solar flares that resulted in CMEs (Coronal Mass Ejections) that were directed toward Earth. Earlier this year (21st of April) there have been a M1.7 class solar flare on the Sun that resulted in CME - mass ejected from the Sun travelled with velocity over 800km/s after 2 days reached the Earth. This can be seen in an animation from  SOHO/LASCO C3 instrument.

This lead to creation of an extensive aurora oval that could be observed even from southern Europe. In Poland Aurora was visible even in zenith. Thanks to <a target="_blank" href="http://alps.astro.uni.wroc.pl">ALPS</a> (All-sky Light Pollution Survey) - which I am a part of - aurora images were captured bu several of observing stations a.o. Ostrowik (ALPS-OST) and Sopotnia Wielka (ALPS-SOP).
