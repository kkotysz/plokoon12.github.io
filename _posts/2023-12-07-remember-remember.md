In recent months there has been an increased solar activity with quite a lot of solar flares that resulted in CMEs (Coronal Mass Ejections) that were directed toward Earth. Earlier this year (21st of April) there have been a M1.7 class solar flare on the Sun that resulted in CME - mass ejected from the Sun travelled with velocity over 800km/s after 2 days reached the Earth. This can be seen in an animation from  SOHO/LASCO C3 instrument.

This lead to creation of an extensive aurora oval that could be observed even from southern Europe. In Poland Aurora was visible even in zenith. Thanks to <a target="_blank" href="http://alps.astro.uni.wroc.pl">ALPS</a> (All-sky Light Pollution Survey) - which I am a part of - aurora images were captured bu several of observing stations a.o. Ostrowik (ALPS-OST) and Sopotnia Wielka (ALPS-SOP).

  But that's not all! Last month on November 5th <img src="/assets/images/guy_fawkes_100px.png" style="height: 1em; display: inline-block;">

<!-- An opportunity to watch a bright comet does not come often. The last one was called __C/1995 O1__ or simply __Comet Hale-Bopp__. It was visible to the naked eye for 18 months!

The hero of this post is not as bright as Hale-Bopp but also can be seen by naked eye. __Comet NEOWISE__ or __C/2020 F3 (NEOWISE)__ is already circumpolar object (in Poland, at the time of writing this post) which means it does not set. It can be seen during whole night over the northern horizon. Comet was discovered March 27, 2020 and two tails (dust and ion) can be seen. The first one by eye and second one in photographs. The nucleus is estimated to be about 5km. As of 16 July brightness was about 2-2.5 mag.

Recently, I had the opportunity to capture __C/2020 F3 (NEOWISE)__ at <a href="http://oab.astro.uni.wroc.pl">Bialkow Observatory</a>. Despite the comet's low altitude, sky in Bialkow is really dark. Along with cloudless nights, conditions for observations were excellent. Below is the photogpraph that I was able to take. Two tails are visible, bright dust one and faint bluish ion tail.
