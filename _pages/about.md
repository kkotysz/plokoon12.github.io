I am an astronomer and PhD student at Astronomical Institute at University of Wroclaw (Poland). Although PhD studies take most of my time, I am trying to find some moments for photography. Mostly I am interested in astrophotography (obviously) but in my gallery day-time photographs also can be found.

In my work I am mostly interested in pulsating stars. Following my passion for photography and observations, I decided to pursue a career in observational astronomy. This involves working with sattelite data and travelling to astronomical observatories all over the world. Currently I am an observer in Bialk√≥w Astronomical Observatory which belongs to University of Wroclaw. I have also spent 3 weeks at observational run in the Atacama dessert in Chile. I am also a member of All-sky Light Pollution Survey (ALPS). In this project we aim to raise awareness of light pollution problem by collectic data and measuring the quality of night sky.
